# NNDL_CAe_image_captioning

This folder contains an advanced implementation of image captioning. Part of Neural Networks and Deep Learning course extra assignment.

## Concepts Covered

### Advanced Image Captioning

Building on basic encoder-decoder, incorporating modern techniques.

### Techniques

- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus on relevant image regions
- **Transformer Decoders**: Self-attention for better sequence modeling
- **Pretrained Models**: Using CLIP, BERT for richer representations
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Combining visual and textual features

### Training Strategies

- Scheduled sampling
- Reinforcement learning (CIDEr optimization)
- Contrastive learning

### Evaluation

- BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr scores
- Diversity metrics
- Human evaluation

### Challenges

- Generating diverse, accurate captions
- Handling abstract concepts
- Computational efficiency

### Applications

- Enhanced accessibility tools
- Content generation
- Multimodal AI systems

## Files

- `code/`: Advanced captioning models
- Dataset: MS COCO or similar

## Results

Advanced models produce more accurate and diverse captions compared to basic RNN approaches.
